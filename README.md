WeatherPy Summary
Objective: The primary goal of WeatherPy.ipynb is to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this, it generates a series of scatter plots to showcase the relationship between latitude and various weather parameters, such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: The script randomly selects a list of cities using the citipy library and then performs API calls to OpenWeatherMap to gather weather data for each city.

Data Analysis: It analyzes the weather data, focusing on the relationship between latitude and weather parameters. This involves creating scatter plots that visualize these relationships and calculating linear regressions to understand the trends better.

Insights: The analysis typically reveals trends like temperatures being higher closer to the equator and potential variability in other parameters like humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed with respect to latitude.

VacationPy Summary
Objective: VacationPy.ipynb aims to use weather data to help plan future vacations. It leverages weather data to identify potential vacation destinations and nearby hotels. Then, it uses Google Maps to visualize these destinations and hotels.

Key Steps:

Data Filtering: Based on the weather data obtained from WeatherPy.ipynb or a similar source, it filters out cities based on preferred weather conditions (e.g., ideal temperature range, humidity).

Hotel Search: For each potential vacation city, it uses Google Places API to find the nearest hotel to the city's coordinates.

Mapping: It creates a Google Maps visualization with markers for each city, displaying information about the city, its weather conditions, and the nearest hotel. The map provides an interactive way to explore potential vacation spots.

Insights: The notebook helps identify vacation spots that meet specific weather preferences and provides practical information about accommodation, assisting in vacation planning.
